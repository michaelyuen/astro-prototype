# <span>my</span>Bio

👋🏻 I'm Michael but some people call me <code>my</code>. I love to create order.

I am a <s>🤖 robot</s>, <s>👽 alien</s>, 👨🏻‍🌾 human bean, and I live in 📍NYC.

I'm also a software engineer and I love building [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). Currently, I work at MLB on [mlb.com](https://www.mlb.com). I recently had the amazing opportunity to lead the frontend development effort of the Cheer at the Ballpark project (💀 rip). Previously, I worked at Resy on [resy.com](https://www.resy.com).

Another hobby I would like take up is writing, so naturally there must be a blog! That's a big part of the motivation behind rebuilding this website, aside from it already being long overdue. To enable myself to efficiently [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public) and share what I enjoy.
